`rollbar_notification` Resource
=========================

Rollbar projects can be configured with different notification integrations (aka "channels") and rules for when to send notifications to those integration platforms.  This resource manages the rules for the project configured for the Rollbar provider.  The notification channels are enabled and disabled through the Rollbar UI.

This resource can manage notification rules for different integration channels.  See the following api documentation for more details about the arguments with respect to each channel:

* [Rollbar API Slack Notification Rules](https://explorer.docs.rollbar.com/#tag/Slack-Notification-Rules)
* [Rollbar API Pagerduty Notification Rules](https://explorer.docs.rollbar.com/#tag/PagerDuty-Notification-Rules)
* [Rollbar API Email Notification Rules](https://explorer.docs.rollbar.com/#tag/Email-Notification-Rules)
